- **Cloud Layer**: Animated cloud cover that rotates independently
- **Atmospheric Glow**: Beautiful atmospheric effect around the Earth
- **Starfield Background**: Thousands of stars in the background for immersion
- **Interactive Controls**: 
  - Scroll to zoom in/out
  - Click and drag to rotate the Earth
  - Right-click and drag to pan
  - Auto-rotation for a dynamic view
- **Click Detection**: Click anywhere on Earth to see coordinates
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application**: Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. **Navigation**:
   - **Zoom**: Use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out
   - **Rotate**: Click and drag to rotate the Earth around
   - **Pan**: Right-click and drag to move the view
3. **Explore**: Click anywhere on the Earth to see the latitude and longitude coordinates
4. **Enjoy**: The Earth automatically rotates slowly for a dynamic experience

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Three.js for 3D graphics
- **Textures**: High-resolution Earth textures from NASA
